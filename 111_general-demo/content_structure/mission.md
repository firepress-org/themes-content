Blogging without a mission statement is a little like going on a trip with no particular destination in mind. How long should you stay on the road? Which direction should you go? If you don’t know where you’re going, how will you know when you get there. If you blog isn’t helping you get where you want to be, then maybe it’s time to create a mission statement.

The term “Mission Statement” sounds pretty official and business-like, but it simply means:

A summary of the aims and values of a company, organization, or individual.
In other words, what do you hope to accomplish with your blog, why do you want to accomplish it, and how do you plan to do it?

How To Write Your Blog’s Mission Statement

What is your reason for blogging?

What do you hope to get out of your blog? Are you blogging to make money? Are you blogging to promote yourself, your product, or your business? Are you blogging to connect with other people with similar interests? What do you want people to think when they see your blog?

What is the purpose of your blog?

It’s important to define the purpose for your blog because this helps you create the type of content that will attract your targeted audience.

For example, if you’re a freelance writer and your the purpose of your blog is to share your knowledge with other would-be freelancers, then you would create informative content that teaches your readers how to develop their writing skills and find freelance jobs.

On the other hand, if you’re a freelance writer and the purpose for your blog is to attract clients, then you’d create content that tells your readers the benefits of outsourcing their content.

How do you plan to reach these goals?

Now you simply connect your blog’s goal and purpose to come up with your mission statement. Here are some examples:

I want to make $20,000 within one year using XYZBlog.com to attract freelance writing clients.
I want XYZBlog.com to become known as an authority site among freelance writers so I can use it to promote my freelance writing guides.
I want to use XYZBlog.com to connect with other freelance writers so we can share writing tips and ideas and learn from each other.
As you can see, writing a mission statement is really pretty easy. While it might seem simplistic, though, it plays an important role in every business. A mission statement helps you keep your goals at the forefront. And trust me, when you’re blogging it’s very easy to lose sight of your ultimate goal because you have so many smaller goals you need to pursue.

For example, traffic generation is always a major concern. Let’s say the freelance writer mentioned above loses sight of his goal to attract writing clients because he’s so focused on generating traffic. So he publishes a killer post about how to write great article titles and he draws in thousands of visitors in just one week.

But all of those visitors are looking for tips on writing – not someone who will do the writing for them – which is why they landed on his post about how to write killer article titles. The freelance writer just wasted his time publishing a post that doesn’t move him any closer to his blogging goal, because he was focused on the wrong goal.

Spend a few minutes creating your blog’s mission statement today and get your blog pointed in the right direction.

# What's the point?

The goal of this repo is to create great dummy content for Ghost demo themes. This way it will be easy to compare various theme because to share the same content.

Actually it's not easy to shop theme because people wants to compare different things for there needs. Examples:

- Long post, for the typical blog writer
- Album galeries, for blog picture oriented
- how the tag page looks like

More details to come.

### Project Name
themes-content/**112_readiness**

### Goal

At [FirePress](http://firepress.org/) ðŸ”¥ðŸ“°, we empower creators, makers and organizations to build outstanding mobile-first websites, that speaks up for them.

Specifically, this is the default **content** we use for all new Ghost installations at FirePress ðŸ”¥ðŸ“°. By doing this extra step for our clients, they can see quickly how their brand new website feels like. As new publishers, they can also understand how it made under the hood.

**Content** here means:

- copywriting files (markdown)
- images
- backup files (json)
- infography file (Keynote, Photoshop)

### License
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE | Version 3, 29 June 2007 | See it [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

No matter how I thurst the open source community, I feel it not *best practice* to: 

1) Use a link that points to a licence writen by a third party 2) Use license(s) proposed by GitHub by default. 

If any changes happen, how do you know it's still right for you? By using scenario #1 or #2, you would put yourself in a position where you may lose the control of what the licence was suppose to mean at the moment you read it. Everyone should fork the license they want to use on there own repos. Mine is [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

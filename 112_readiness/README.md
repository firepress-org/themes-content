### Project Name
themes-content/**112_readiness**

### Goal 
This is the default **content** we setup for all new Ghost installation at [FirePress](http://firepress.org/). By doing this extra step for our clients, they can have a great idea about how their site feels like. As new publishers, they can also see and understand how it made under the hood.

**Content** here means:

- copywriting files (markdown)
- images
- backup files (json)
- infography file (Keynote, Photoshop)

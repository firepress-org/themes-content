During my last trip around the world, I capture few pictures. Here are my favorites! This is a simple placeholder. These words won’t make any sense and it's fine. The goal here is to focus on the container not on the content.

Donec eget blandit nisl. Sed laoreet, ex id venenatis tincidunt, nisi ex gravida justo, eget vulputate dolor sem vel erat. Vivamus porta at sem vel dictum. Donec egestas euismod consequat.

## Albums Preview

Here is how to use pictures as your album previews.

**The fancy stuff** — The text slapped on top of those three pictures was produce using [Keynotes](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/). Of course, you can use this project for free too ;)

### Preview albums from one page

Creating a preview is the action of aggregating, "to combine" or to put things together. 

When you have many-many-many photos and albums it's a great idea to create **previews** and aggregate your albums into one place. You could have one main page ([like this one](/focusing-on-pictures/)) where your visitor can preview a picture of each of your albums. 

The same concept apply for videos or podcast. A great example is how Tim Ferris does it for it's [Podcast page](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/).

At the end, the whole idea is to make it easy for people to find what you have created. 

To learn how create a link on a picture, go to:

- Lesson #1
- Clickable image

### Tags

A more advanced concept is to use tags. Maybe you want to filter the way we see your work by 

- #years
- #country
- #style *(i.e. fashion, events,  sports)*
- #agencies
- etc.

Tag allows you to create a feed about a particular topic.

In some case I would use both so there is two ways to search your albums. See how Pascal [use this concept](http://blog.pascalandy.com/trouver-par-tags/) on his personal blog.

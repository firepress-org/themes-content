**Page aggregation** â€” In the case you would have many albums, you could have one main page (or post) where your visitor can preview all your albums. Another advantage of creating a dedicated `page aggregation` is SEO. To learn how to do this, go to:

- http://blog.firepress.org/learn/
- Lesson #1
- Clickable image

Another way to do it could be to use a tag like *Album* or *Travel*. In some case I would use both so there is two ways to search your albums. See how Pascal [use this concept](http://blog.pascalandy.com/trouver-par-tags/) on his personal blog.

**Sara's advice** — Here are some ideas for you:

- Show a SMS screenshot of a `Good job! Thank you!`
- Put pictures of gifts you received from clients
- Put picture of an event where you received a prize from your pears
- Insert a video — Interview a client and let him/her express how you helped
- Show an email screenshot of a testimonial
- Use GIF that share the spirit of your testimonials
- etc.

Get creative it's not that hard to show your credibility

**Sara's advice** — Here are some ideas for you:

- A screenshot of a "good job" SMS messages
- Pictures of gifts you received from clients
- Picture of an event where you received a prize from your pears
- Video — Interview a client and let him/her express how you helped
- Share an email copy
- Use GIF that share the spirit of your testimonials
- etc.

Get creative it's not that hard to show your credibility :)

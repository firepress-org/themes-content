## 1) Welcome
Hey there, I‚Äôm Sara! It‚Äôs a big day for you and I want to congratulate you because‚Ä¶ **your website is online** üëå. I setup and pre-configured your website so you can quickly see how it feels. Sounds fair?

You will see I carefully edited the content with elements you expect to see within a `Stage 1` website. Things like:

- Titles, links, bold, italic, etc.
- Pictures in the headers of each post & page
- Picture within a post & page
- Embed YouTube videos
- Embed animated GIF
- Organize the navigation (menu)

So go for it and **take a moment to surf on your new website**! You will find these posts & pages:

1. You rock! (aka, your site is online)
2. Let me help you
3. Contact
4. About me
5. Biography
6. *(can you find the sixth one?)*

> So tell me‚Ä¶ how does it feels???

## 2) One step a time

During your website‚Äôs setup, **I consciously left out many elements** you could put on your website. **I made this decision in order to not overwhelm you**. When you will be ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do fancy things like:

- Edit SEO for you content
- Work with tags
- Tables (basic)
- Pricing tables
- Manage picture albums and visual first websites
- Embed all types of external source (audio, slides, pdf, download link, e-commerce, online payment, etc.)
- Pages like : team, policies
- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) 
- Edit the navigation bar
- Code injection and what you do with it
- Create and manage a mailing list
- Add Analytics
- etc.

To conclude on this point, **here is my advice**: take it one step at a time. Don‚Äôt rush things. Becoming a publisher and **running a website that acts like your impresario** it not a small task. It‚Äôs a mindset that takes time even for great marketers. For now, don‚Äôt worry at about features that might by missing in your preconfigured website.

Hey there, I'm Sara! It's a big day for you and I want to congratulate you because... **your website is online** ðŸ‘Œ. I setup and preconfigured your website so you can quickly see how it feels. Sounds fair enough?

You will see I carefully edited the content with elements you expect to see within a `Stage 1` website. Things like:

- Titles, links, bold, italic, etc.
- Pictures in the headers of each post & page
- Picture within a post & page
- Embed YouTube videos
- Embed animated GIF
- Organize the navigation (menu)

So go for it and **take a moment to surf on your new website**! You will find these posts & pages:

1. Welcome in your digital home
2. Focusing on pictures
3. Services
4. Contact
5. About me
6. Biography
7. Testimonials

**So tell me... how does it feel**?

## One step a time

When I setup your website, **I left out many elements** that could be included on your website. **I made this decision not to overwhelm you**. When you are ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do fancy things like:

- Edit SEO for you content
- Work with tags
- Tables (basic)
- Pricing tables
- Manage picture albums and visual first websites
- Embed elements like audio, slides, pdf, download links, e-commerce, online payment, etc.
- Pages like : team, policies
- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) 
- Edit the navigation bar
- Code injection and what you do with it
- Create and manage a mailing list
- Add Analytics
- etc.

To conclude on this point, **here is my advice**: take it one step at a time. 

<div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 49.8853%;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6ZW5f40T12iLS/twitter/iframe" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div></div><br>

Don't rush things. Becoming a publisher and **running a website that acts like your impresario** it not a small task. It's a mindset that takes time even for great marketers. For now, don't worry about all options.

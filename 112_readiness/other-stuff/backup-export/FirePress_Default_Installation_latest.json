Feel free to edit it and/or delete it*.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Welcome\nHey there, I'm Sara! It's a big day for you and I want to congratulate you because... **your website is online** 👌. I setup and preconfigured your website so you can quickly see how it feels. Sounds fair enough?\n\nYou will see I carefully edited the content with elements you expect to see within a `Stage 1` website. Things like:\n\n- Titles, links, bold, italic, etc.\n- Pictures in the headers of each post & page\n- Picture within a post & page\n- Embed YouTube videos\n- Embed animated GIF\n- Organize the navigation (menu)\n\nSo go for it and **take a moment to surf on your new website**! You will find these posts & pages:\n\n1. You rock! (aka, your site is online)\n2. Let me help you\n3. Contact\n4. About me\n5. Biography\n6. Good news: Phil is joining the team!\n7. Testimonials\n\n> So tell me... how does it feel???\n\n> <div><div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 49.8853%;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/gZq7GstcdqVXi/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\"></iframe></div></div><br>\n\n--- \n\n## 2) One step a time\n\nDuring your website's setup, **I left out many elements** that could be included on your website. **I made this decision not to overwhelm you**. When you are ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do fancy things like:\n\n- Edit SEO for you content\n- Work with tags\n- Tables (basic)\n- Pricing tables\n- Manage picture albums and visual first websites\n- Embed elements like audio, slides, pdf, download links, e-commerce, online payment, etc.\n- Pages like : team, policies\n- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) \n- Edit the navigation bar\n- Code injection and what you do with it\n- Create and manage a mailing list\n- Add Analytics\n- etc.\n\nTo conclude on this point, **here is my advice**: take it one step at a time. Don't rush things. Becoming a publisher and **running a website that acts like your impresario** it not a small task. It's a mindset that takes time even for great marketers. For now, don't worry at about all the options.\n## \n<div><div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 49.8853%;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/6ZW5f40T12iLS/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\"></iframe></div></div><br>\n\n---\n\n## 3) Start your journey here\n\nAs a **publisher**, you need to get familiar about editing and posting content on your site.

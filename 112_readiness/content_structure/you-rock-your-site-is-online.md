Hey there!

You should be able to find quickly these posts & pages:

- You rock! (aka, your site is online)
- Let me help you

... and elements like:

- Text edits like: **bold**, *italic*, [link](/you-rock-your-site-is-online/), title 
- Post/Pages
- Pictures in headers

- Configure the navigation
- ... and all the basic stuff you expect for great basic `Stage 1` website.

### Features I left out

To avoid overwhelming you, **I consciously left out many things** you can do with your website when I preconfigured it. When you will be ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do things like:

- Edit SEO for you content
- Work with tags
- Manage picture albums and visual first websites
- Embed all types of external source (audio, slides, pdf, download link, e-commerce, online payment, etc.)
- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) 
- Edit the navigation bar
- Code injection and what you do with it
- Create and manage a mailing list
- Add Analytics
- etc.

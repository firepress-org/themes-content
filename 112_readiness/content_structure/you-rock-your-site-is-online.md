Hey there!

I'm Nadine. Let me congratulate you because your site is up and running (and it's rock solid if you ask me).

I preconfigured your website to help you quickly see the possibilities by yourself. Take a moment to navigate your site!

You should be able to find quickly these **posts & pages**:

- You rock! (aka, your site is online)
- Let me help you
- Contact
- About me
- Biography

I made basic formatting like:

- Bold, italic, link, title 
- Pictures in headers
- Picture in posts/pages
- Embed a YouTube videos
- Embed a GIPHY gif
- Organise the navigation (menu)
- ... and all the basic stuff you expect for great basic `Stage 1` website. 

So, how does it feels?

## Start your journey

As a the **owner** and the **publisher** of this site, take 5-10 minutes to get familiar about posting new content on your site. We carefully prepared [this](http://blog.firepress.org/learn/) documentation. You will rock the web in minutes.

## Features I left out

<div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 49.8853%;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6ZW5f40T12iLS/twitter/iframe" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div></div><br>

To avoid overwhelming you, **I consciously left out many things** you can do with your website when I preconfigured it. When you will be ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do things like:

- Edit SEO for you content
- Work with tags
- Tables (basic)
- Pricing tables
- Manage picture albums and visual first websites
- Embed all types of external source (audio, slides, pdf, download link, e-commerce, online payment, etc.)
- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) 
- Edit the navigation bar
- Code injection and what you do with it
- Create and manage a mailing list
- Add Analytics
- etc.

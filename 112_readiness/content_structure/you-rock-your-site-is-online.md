Hey there!

Nadine here. I want to congratulate you because well... your site is up and running!

As you can, I did preconfigured for you so you can quickly understand the basics and the possibilities. You will see that I put pictures, videos, links and all the basic stuff your expect for a `Stage 1` website. 

Take a moment to navigate your site. Here are all the posts and the pages you should be able to see:

- About Me
- Biography
- You rock! (aka, your site is online)

**Next** â€” As a the owner and the publisher of this site, take 5-10 minutes to get familiar about posting new content on your site. We carefully prepared some documentation for you so can will be rocking the web in minutes.

See you at http://blog.firepress.org/learn/.

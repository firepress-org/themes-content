## 1) Welcome
Hey there, I'm Sara! It's a big day for you and I want to congratulate you because ... **your website is online**. I did setup and preconfigured your website so you can quickly see how it feels.

I carefully edited the content with the elements you expect to see within a `Stage 1` website. Things like:

- Titles, links, bold, italic, etc.
- Pictures in the headers of each post & page
- Picture within a post & page
- Embed a YouTube video
- Embed an animated Gif (via GIPHY)
- Organise the navigation (menu)

So go for it and **take a moment to surf on your new website**! You will find these five posts & pages:

1. You rock! (aka, your site is online)
2. Let me help you
3. Contact
4. About me
5. Biography

## 2) One step a time

During the setup, **I consciously left out many things** you can do with your website. I made this decision in order to not overwhelm you. When you will be ready to move on to a `Stage 2` website, you will be able to do things like:

- Edit SEO for you content
- Work with tags
- Tables (basic)
- Pricing tables
- Manage picture albums and visual first websites
- Embed all types of external source (audio, slides, pdf, download link, e-commerce, online payment, etc.)
- Using icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) 
- Edit the navigation bar
- Code injection and what you do with it
- Create and manage a mailing list
- Add Analytics
- etc.

**So please take it one step at a time :)** Becoming a publisher it not a small task. It's a mindset that takes time. For now, don't worry at about features that might by missing in your preconfigured website.

## My mission

http://jmp.sh/EQWzrGP (audio)

[*the-why*] I love software. I always been fascinated by the power hidden behind machines and lines of code. When I saw for the first time the movie “The Matrix”, this was a revelation. This passion for software made me realize over the years that…

[*the-how*] My mission is to help people to share with the world what THEY DO BEST! I want them to realize they don’t have to wait to get pick anymore. Thanks to the web, now you, everyone can say: “Here, check this out! I made this … and if you want, if you like it, I can do it for you too.” 

**I just happen to build great and user-friendly websites**.

[*the-what*] At the core, this is what I do. I help brands and entrepreneurs to put in place an outstanding website for them. Once their new site is online, it becomes their home on the web.  Their new digital identity. A place where they can manage their own content easily and have fun while doing it.

There is only one condition to do business with us: You have a service/project/cause/product to share with the world. Now, here’s the good news. 

**Setting up your website is as easy as 1-2-3**.

1) Define your domain name (URL)
3) Select a [theme](http://publiodigital.com/themes)
4) Reserve your place to attend our [real-time online workshop](http://publiodigital.com/live-workshop). In 90 minutes, I will help you to put your website together and teach you how to operate it as an editor.

**In the end, this is what you get**:

You are happy and you have an outstanding website. You learned how to edit and published your content. You know how to embed video, forms, appointment tools, upload pictures. You know how to think like an editor. Fear of working on your website is a thing from the past (I've been there with my old site on WordPress). Your project grows and we’re officially a TEAM! At this point, this is just the beginning.

Just [sign-up here](http://publiodigital.com) and start today.

Cheers!
Pascal

P.S. My goal is that by February 2020, I will help over 2,000,000 people to put together their online identity. By February 2030, I will help over 100,000,000 people to connect with the people they can help. Hopefully, I can do it for you too.
